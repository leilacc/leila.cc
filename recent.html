    <h3>December</h3>
    <p>It's finals week (or, at least, U of T's 2-week marathon equivalent).
    Luckily for me, 2/3 of my exams were on the first day, so I'm almost done already!
    </p><p>
    I'm planning on using some of my newfound free time 
    to redesign this site 
    using the JavaScript skillz I picked up in 
    <a href="http://coursewiz.leila.cc/courses/685/">CSC 309</a> 
    this semester. Maybe add a blog. Play around a bit. We'll see what happens!</p>
    <p>
    <h3>October</h3>
    <p>Wow, moving back to Toronto and getting back into school and hockey has meant a whirlwind of activity lately.
    I don't even know where September went!</p>
    <p>
    <h3>August</h3>
    <p>My summer in California is almost over, and although I've had a great time these past couple of weeks -
       hiking in <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yosemite_National_Park'>Yosemite</a>,
       seeing some great acts at <a href='http://sfoutsidelands.com'>Outside Lands</a>,
       and learning to surf with <a href='http://www.santacruzsurfschool.com/'>these awesome guys in Santa Cruz</a> -
       I'm excited to get back to Toronto. The worst part will be saying goodbye to all the wonderful people I've met (and my favourite Google cafes!).</p>
    <br>
    <h3>July</h3>
    <p>The internship is going great! There was a long two-week orientation but I'm settled in now, and my pod is close to finishing our first project, a backend tool for the Mobile Search team.</p>
    <p> I also just released <a href='http://coursewiz.leila.cc'>Coursewiz</a>, a course selection aid for U of T students. I've been getting some great feedback and I'm really excited that my site is actually helping people!</p>
    <br>
	<h3>June</h3>
    <p>I'm currently working on a site to help U of T students make better course selections. Then I'm super excited to start working at <a href="http://google.com">Google</a> on the 19th!</p>
